}
```

## Analysis Components

### 1. Risk Warnings
- Specific safety concerns for each medicine
- Potential drug interactions between medicines
- Contraindications and precautions
- Side effects to monitor

### 2. Suggested Tests
- Blood tests recommended for monitoring
- Imaging studies that might be needed
- Vital signs to track regularly
- Specialized tests for specific medicines

### 3. Predictive Insights
- Potential health outcomes based on medicine combinations
- Risk factors that may develop
- Timeline for expected effects
- Warning signs to watch for

### 4. Detailed Report
Comprehensive markdown report for each medicine including:
- Medicine Name
- Primary Use
- Risk Warnings
- Required Monitoring
- Potential Side Effects
- Drug Interactions
- Lifestyle Considerations
- Follow-up Requirements

## Integration with Existing System

### Prescription Analysis Enhancement
The existing prescription analysis now uses the new predictive insights function:
- Medicine names are extracted from prescription images/text
- Predictive insights are generated using Gemini AI
- Enhanced analysis results include predictive insights

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- New fields are optional and have default values
- Existing analysis results are preserved

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **No Medicine Names**: Returns 400 error if medicine_names is empty
2. **Gemini API Issues**: Returns 500 error with detailed message
3. **Invalid Medicine Names**: Handles gracefully with fallback analysis

### Fallback Behavior
- If JSON parsing fails, provides basic analysis
- If specific medicines aren't recognized, uses general medical guidance
- Always includes medical disclaimers and consultation recommendations

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd Jeeva_AI_BackEnd
python test_medicine_analysis.py
```

### Manual Testing
Use the API endpoint with sample medicine names:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ai/analyze/medicines/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "medicine_names": ["Metformin", "Lisinopril"],
    "patient_id": "test_patient",
    "title": "Test Analysis"
  }'
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key for AI analysis
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: For medicine information lookup (optional)

### Database Migration
The new fields require a database migration:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations ai_analysis
python manage.py migrate
```

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Ensure Gemini API key is properly secured
2. **Input Validation**: Medicine names are validated and sanitized
3. **Medical Disclaimers**: All responses include appropriate medical disclaimers
4. **Data Privacy**: Patient data is handled according to privacy requirements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Medicine Database Integration**: Direct integration with medicine databases
2. **Dosage Analysis**: Include dosage information in analysis
3. **Patient History**: Consider patient medical history in predictions
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of medicine effects
5. **Alert System**: Automated alerts for potential issues

## Support

For issues or questions regarding the Medicine Analysis API:
1. Check the test script for basic functionality
2. Review error logs for detailed error information
3. Verify API key configuration
4. Ensure database migrations are applied
